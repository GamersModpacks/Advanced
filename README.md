### [Project Webpage](https://gamersmodpacks.github.io/posts/GamersAdvanced/)


**GamersAdvanced** is a Minecraft modpack that takes players to a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by nuclear war. This modpack combines technical mods that allow players to create complex machines and devices with survival elements such as thirst, temperature, and sanity. The predecessor of [**GamersWarfared**](https://github.com/GamersModpacks/GamersWarfared).

This modpack is built with [**Packwiz**](https://packwiz.infra.link/), a command-line tool for creating, editing, and distributing Minecraft modpacks. Packwiz uses the TOML format to store modpack metadata, which makes it easy to version and share with git.
## Features

- **Technical mods**: Applied Energistics 2, Mekanism, Create, Dynamic Electricity, and others allow players to create complex automation, production, and resource-gathering systems.

- **Survival elements**: Thirst, temperature, and sanity add new challenges and opportunities to the game. Players must be careful to drink enough water, avoid freezing or overheating, and keep their sanity from being overwhelmed by the horrors they have experienced.

- **Ruined cities**: In the GamersAdvanced world, players can explore the ruins of cities that were built before the war. These ruins can contain valuable resources as well as ancient divine relics.
