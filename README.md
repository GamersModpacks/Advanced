### [Project Webpage](https://gamersmodpacks.github.io/posts/GamersAdvanced/)


**GamersAdvanced** is a Minecraft modpack that takes players to a post-apocalyptic world destroyed by war. This modpack combines technical mods that allow players to create complex machines and devices with survival elements such as temperature and sanity. The predecessor of [**GamersWarfared**](https://github.com/GamersModpacks/GamersWarfared).

This modpack is built with [**Packwiz**](https://packwiz.infra.link/), a command-line tool for creating, editing, and distributing Minecraft modpacks. Packwiz uses the TOML format to store modpack metadata, which makes it easy to version and share with git.
## Features

- **Technical mods**: Applied Energistics 2, Mekanism, Create, Dynamic Electricity, and others allow players to create complex automation, production, and resource-gathering systems.

- **Survival elements**: Temperature and sanity add new challenges and opportunities to the game. Players must be careful to avoid freezing or overheating, and keep their sanity from being overwhelmed by the horrors they have experienced.
